# Data-Preprocessing
The Canada by Citizenship dataset has been imported using the pandas with direct importation of the Excel file. Metadata rows at the beginning of the sheet were ignored to make sure that the appropriate header row was selected. Column names were translated into strings and purified to standardize the year labels by taking off formats that Excel adds to the year labels.
The columns (1980-2013) indicate the years, they were programmatically identified and transformed into numeric values, as well as the cases of missing numbers or non-numeric values were treated safely. The information was then filtered to contain information on foreign-born immigrants only, and not aggregate categories like Total and Unknown.
Finally, columns were renamed for clarity, total immigration counts were computed across all years, and a formatted view of selected years was created to match the required output structure.
